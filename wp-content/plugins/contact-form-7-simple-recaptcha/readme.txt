== Description ==

Protect your Contact Form 7 forms with **Google reCAPTCHA V2**, **Google reCAPTCHA V3**, **hCAPTCHA**, or **Cloudflare Turnstile**.

Easy integration and supports multiple forms on a single page.

## Four CAPTCHA Options

Choose the CAPTCHA provider that works best for you:

- **Google reCAPTCHA V2** — The industry-standard "I'm not a robot" checkbox, trusted by millions of sites.
- **Google reCAPTCHA V3** — The industry-standard invisible score-based verification, trusted by millions of sites.
- **hCAPTCHA** — A privacy-first alternative that offers robust bot protection while keeping user data secure.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — A modern CAPTCHA that verifies users in the background, only requiring a simple click if the visitor appears suspicious.

## Simple Setup

1. Sign up with your chosen CAPTCHA provider and grab your Site Key and Secret Key.
2. Paste them into **CF7 Captcha** in your WordPress admin.
3. Add protection to any CF7 form in seconds using the shortcode provided in the same settings page.

## Customizable Appearance

Each CAPTCHA widget supports customization options directly from the shortcode:

- **Size** — Choose between normal and compact to fit your form layout.
- **Theme** — Switch between light and dark themes (or auto for Turnstile) to match your site's design.
- **Language** — Force any CAPTCHA to render in a specific language for your audience.

All options are combinable, so you can mix and match to get the exact look you need.

## Submission Insights (NEW in v0.1.7)

Go beyond just blocking spam. Submission Insights gives you full visibility into every form submission:

- **Sender IP** — See the IP address of the person who contacted you.
- **Source Page** — Know exactly which page on your site the form was filled out on.
- **Device & Browser** — Get technical details about the sender's setup.

== 🚀 Want More? Upgrade to CF7 Captcha Pro ==

This free version gives you solid CAPTCHA protection. But the smartest bots are already solving CAPTCHAs.

**CF7 Captcha Pro** adds six extra layers of invisible spam defense on top of what you already have here, plus a full set of tools to capture and act on every lead your forms collect.

=== What you get with Pro ===

**6-Layer Spam Defense** — stops 99.9% of spam without ever bothering your visitors:
- **Advanced Honeypot** — invisible trap fields with names that regenerate every 24 hours.
- **Time Limit Validation** — bots submit in 0.2 seconds. Humans take 15–30. This blocks anything that moves too fast (or stays too long).
- **Rate Limiting** — caps submissions per IP so bot networks can't flood your inbox or burn through your email quota.
- **Geographic Blocking** — whitelist only the countries you serve, or blacklist known spam regions.
- **IP Pattern Blocking** — block single IPs, wildcards, CIDR ranges, or entire subnets when you know exactly where an attack is coming from.
- **Word Filter** — scans every submission for spam keywords, phishing URLs, and known scam phrases before it reaches you.

**Lead Recovery** — 70% of people who start filling out a form never submit it. Pro captures their data in real-time as they type, so you can follow up on leads that would otherwise vanish.

**Database Storage & Export** — every submission is saved with full metadata (IP, browser, referrer, timestamp). Export to CSV, Excel, JSON, or PDF whenever you need it. No more lost leads if your email fails.

**Webhooks** — send form data instantly to any URL. Connect to Zapier, Salesforce, Slack, Google Sheets, or any custom API. Multiple webhooks per form, with retry logic built in.

**Mailchimp Integration** — submissions automatically added to your Mailchimp lists. Field mapping, tags, opt-in handling.

**Twilio SMS** — receive instant alerts for every submission or send automated SMS replies to your clients.

**Comprehensive Logging** — every spam block, webhook call, and integration event is logged. Debug any issue in minutes instead of hours.
